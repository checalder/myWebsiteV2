I had alot of fun with this, trying to understand the basics of the unity class libraries was (and still is) quite challenging but I managed to make this with it.

I also am implementing a reload feature with its own reload icon on the corresponding inventory slot that must be held down to reload your food objects. I have been working on the game all day for more or less 14 hours straight as there is so much to this. It has been quite the undertaking but it is finally coming together, I almost have it working perfectly.</p>

                        <p style="margin: 10px">20/03/2023 - With the life, slot and reloading system added; I decided to separate the difficuly increases into levels that change with the terrain. I have also implemented a final boss type character on stage 5 which is essentially just a big chicken that takes more food to kill but moves slower on the screen aswell as the other animals.</p>

                        <p style="margin: 10px">21/03/2023 - I added boss music and victory music aswell as a final secret 6th level that is only accessed upon beating level 5. The 6th level goes on forever and gets harder over time so no matter what you will lose eventually, but this allows players to get their own unique highscore past the winscreen. Furthermore, I have finetuned the animal speed and spawn rates on each of the levels to be more fair but also challenging - I think i have it just right. Overall, I feel finished with this project and am very satisfied with how it is now.</p>

            <h1>Zelda Prototype (WIP)</h1>
            <p style="width: 77svw;">I want to make an adventure game similar to the legend of zelda ocarina of time. The idea came to me and I have been meaning to work on it ever since.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 10px">10/06/2023 - To start with, I have been experimenting with the camera and control types. The objecitve was to make the camera move with the mouse which is much harder than you might expect. I have had to delve much deeper into unity's new input system which can get very complicated. Then use the input to alter the rotation of the camera. This is difficult to do because the camera rotation values are in quaternions and quaternions should never be directly altered in unity unless absolutely neccesary. Thus i had to convert values back and forth between vector3s and quaternions which got very complicated, however, now i have a working camera system that can be re-used in any first person or 3rd person game i make.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 10px">14/06/2023 - Now the problem with the third person camera is that the character is always over the shoulder of the player. This is fine apart from when the player wants to run away but still be able to move the camera to look around independantely like in an open world game such as GTA or, as is the ultimate goal of this project, The legend of zelda. I will be working on this next.</p>
